# grooveTechProject

To execute the project just import it to your machine and run it. The Chrome driver is inside the project itself. Remembering that your machine must contain Maven, Jdk or jre and some IDE to import the project.

The project is in the Java programming language.

Challenge 01 - WebSite: It is successfully registering and validating the website using the BDD methodology with cucumber and validating tests with Junit. The concept of PageObjects is being used and dynamic data generation is being done with JFairy, so feel free to run as many times as you want without duplication. The random choice of options with boxes, checkboxes and radios is also being applied. In addition I added a class to generate a print for test evidence after validation, the print is being saved inside the resources / print folder.
